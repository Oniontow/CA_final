# NTUEE Computer Architecture 2024 Fall

### HW 1 : Assembly language
Problem 1 : The extended Euclidean algorithm
Problem 2 : Longest Substring without Repeating Characters
Problem 3 : Linked List Cycle

### HW 2 : Simple ALU Unit
Implement an unsigned multiplier, an unsigned divider,
as well as a few arithmetic, logical, comparison, and shift operations. 
Combine these operations into a single unit.

### Final project : Single-Cycle RISC-V CPU
Implement a single-cycle CPU and handle multi-cycle operations.
CPU should support the following instructions to pass all the patterns.
 • lw, sw
 • add, sub, addi, slli, srli, srai, slti
 • beq, bne, bge, blt, jal, jalr, auipc, lui
 • mul, divu, remu
